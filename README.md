# Task-Scheduling-System-with-Email-notification
Developed a Task Scheduling System using React.js and Node.js with Express Router. Users can create, edit, and track tasks through a React dashboard. Axios handles API communication, while backend REST APIs automatically send task details to specified e-mail person and send email alerts 1hour and 30 minutes before deadlines and manage Upcoming, Completed, and Missed tasks
